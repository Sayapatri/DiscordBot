# DiscordBot
The information regarding this bot is to get you a running local version of the python bot 
This is a respository for a test bot for the discord server, exrtra features including interative response and spam removaal are yet to added
## Set up a test server
As python bot is coupled with the python discord server you need to have the functional vesion of the bot and the server with channels. i personally dont recommend using a single channel for all the cogs as it will cause more spams and hard to handle.
## Set up a bot acccount
on discord we will need our own bot account to test our codes and changes
## Configure the bot 
to configure the bot we'll need the bot's code and server to run it on.
## Run it
